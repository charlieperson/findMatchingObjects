# findMatchingObjects

Finding all matching objects in an array
Given an array of players (objects), return the names of all players that have a score above 100.

DO NOT use .filter() in your solution.

DO use a for loop.

TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after youâ€™ve solved it using a for loop.

Examples
####Input:
players: [ { "name": "Alice", "score": 88 }, { "name": "Bob", "score": 120 } ]
####Output:
["Bob"]
